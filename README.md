# Project to help you study efficiently

Notes to setup the preoject properly

```sh
    $ docker compose up -d
```

```sh
    $ go mod install
```

```sh
    $ go run /cmd/api/main.go
```

The project is not using migrations, so you have to execute the sql schemas manually (schemas are inside /sql folder)
